Designing a program that will be used as a versatile decision-making system based on user input. There are several places where this application can be used. An example is online Technical Support for a product or group of products. A series of questions might be asked and based on the answers, a different branch of questions will be asked as follow-up-questions to determine exactly how to help the user. Another example is a telephone Technical Support, like a 1-800 number. When calling a 1-800 number, you might communicate with a machine. A series of questions are asked and as answers you typically press the numbers on the keypad, 1-9. After determining exactly what the problem is, a simple answer is usually possible. 

In this assignment, the tree can handle 9-ary trees (up to 9 children). The trees represent the flow of data. In each node in the tree there will be a question to ask. The "answers" will be branches towards more questions in the tree.
